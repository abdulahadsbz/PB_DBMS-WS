## How To Run  
### Disclaimer
for now the code is in a early version so i have not yet made a good way to do this  
but that will come with some time  
  
### Steps To Run  
1. download all the files in src to a folder  
2. run PBDB.py first then run PBWS.py  
3. Select which value bonds you want to add to the database ex 100 or 1500 or any prizebond value 
4. wait for all the draws to be added to the database
5. it should be done now, open the database to check or simply check its filesize 

## How To Access The Data
1. install a sqlite3 database searcher
2. open the PBDB.db file in it

## Why Am I Getting Errors On Some Draws  
i have put a @ symbol in some draw links in the Info.txt file  
this is done because those links were not ordered correctly and  
may have incorrect information  

another reason maybe some network errors or if you may get  
a error telling you the bonds in a draw were very less (this error  
is usually correct)  

## What Does It Do And How  
it scrapes prize bond pages on https://hamariweb.com using the requests library after  
scraping it parses it using bs4 and then it gets all the bond info like PrizeBondNumber,
PrizeBondRank, PrizeBondValue, DrawNumber, DrawDate, DrawLocation to it and then adds all of these to a sqlite3
database

## TODO
- make it put the bonds into a CSV file instead of a DB file
- get data from an secondary source (https://prizebond.net) and compare it to the primary source
